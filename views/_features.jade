          | Jeet is built on CSS preprocessors. It's capable of doing a lot of programatic calculations that CSS can't. As such, you're no longer limited to classes like
          code .col-6
          | . Instead, you can pass
          span.italic  any
          |  fraction, decimal, or combination of the two, to create a completely custom grid.
