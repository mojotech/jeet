Note
---

We're currently working on another npm package and will be expanding on the doc with screencasts and such. To be honest, I just wanted to start using Jeet 3 for a few personal projects of mine. Jeet 2 is still available under the [Jeet2 branch](https://github.com/CorySimmons/jeet/tree/jeet2) so you can download it and use `jeet watch` in those project directories.

Also, we're dropping support for SCSS but I expect someone ([@ozamorowski](https://github.com/ozamorowski)) will fork/port Jeet 3 sooner than later.
